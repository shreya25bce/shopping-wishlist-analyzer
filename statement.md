# Project Statement

**Shopping Wishlist Cost Analyzer**

## Problem Statement

Students often need a simple tool to maintain and analyse their personal shopping wishlists, track budgets, and understand spending patterns. Existing tools are either too complex, online-only, or lack multi-user support. This project provides an offline, lightweight Python Tkinter application to solve this problem.

## Scope of the Project

* Enable users to maintain personal wishlists with item details stored in CSV format.
* Allow category-wise analysis of spending using charts.
* Provide budget-tracking features with alerts.
* Support multiple users and an admin mode for consolidated viewing.
* Offer basic item operations such as add, edit, delete, search, sort, and import/export.
* Ensure the interface is simple, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Target Users

* Students managing personal expenses and wishlists.
* Users needing an offline desktop tool for small-scale budget tracking.
* Faculty evaluating VITyarthi project submissions.

## High-Level Features

* Multi-user mode with separate CSV files.
* Admin mode to view all users’ bills.
* Add, edit, delete, search, and sort wishlist items.
* Category analysis via pie chart visualisation.
* Budget alerts with colour-coded indicators.
* IST auto-date filling.
* Import/export CSV functionality.
* Light/Dark theme switching.
